            I was part of this project, building the iOS app and the protocol to control the light builb. The project
            was the result of a competition at
            %a{:href => "https://www.facebook.com/swseamaker?ref=stream&hc_location=stream"} Seattle Startup Weekend Maker Edition.
            It was led by Kyle Kesterson, the guy in charge of the crew at
