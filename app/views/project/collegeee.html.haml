            %h1 Capstone project: Wireless charging drone station

            %p
                From my experience working with wireless power I realized that there was potential in building more applications for it, so I chose this theme for my capstone project with Professor Shwetak Patel: a wireless charging station for the

                As the team lead, I worked on the wireless system for the charging station and the AI pathfinding to the station when the drone is low on battery. I suggested and was offered guidance from Alanson Sample, a postdoc, and Ben Waters, a graduate student, both at Sensor Lab, for coil design and power testing. We found out that charging an operating (flying) drone required too much current for our station to generate, so we had to park the drone while charging was on. Also, the coilâ€™s weight and size made it significantly difficult for the drone to stay on its path, so we had to make modifications to the frame and protective shell. Despite these challenges, we presented a working charging station for the final presentation. After this, I began my interest in embedded devices that can harness energy from alternative sources.

                While working as an undergraduate teaching assistant, I tried to learn some web programming using Javascript, PHP and HTML (that was before Rails was popular).
                The website was used as the class's official online space, so I had a good time being the web admin and getting students' feedback to improve it.

                This is a DDR simulation, using an LED matrix and buttons as user input. The direction is up.
                When an LED turns yellow, player must press the corresponding button for the collumn to earn points.
                If the note reaches the last row and turn red, points are taken.

                This was done using a FPGA and a LED matrix.
