      I implemented the SPH based on Eurographics'

      and Matthias MÃ¼ller's
      = link_to("Particle-Based Fluid Simulation for Interactive Applications.", "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=846298")


    %p
      All the implementation was built from the ground up with external libraries (see Github page's README for more details), including OpenGL, NanoGUI, TBB, and OpenVDB. The SPH solver itself is done on the CPU, but I plan to move it to GPU for performance improvement. More details coming soon.
