                Assylium is an interactive fiction that takes place in a fantasy realm of corpse readers and necromancers. The story follows Ashmore, a new apprentice at the largest corpse archive in the city, the Mortheneum. Secrets and lies abound, and when Ashmore finds his life threatened by the dark minds of Assylium, he must find a way to defend himself and decipher his future.
