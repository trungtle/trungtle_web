        %p
            This is a text based game inspired by a poem by Max Ehrmann,
            %a(href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gongsu/desiderata_textonly.html" target="_blank") Desiderata.
            The game sets up an encounter between a human and a beast in a distant forest,
            in which the human is seeking help for his sick village.
            In order to do so, he must first pass a series of test from the beast.

            I want to explore a way of using games as a mean of communication and
            simulate questions about things that are un-ordinary.

            I built Desiderata with a custom game engine on top of the pygame framework.
