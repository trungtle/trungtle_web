  %h1 About

  %p Passionate graphics developer and game designer. I believe that video games are an important art form with the ability to impact society in a meaningful way.

  / %p He adores Seattle, having studied and worked there for the last 6 years. The other adorable city is Saigon, having born and raised there for more than 15 years.

  /*%p He loves to live inside his head. As a result, he enjoys being alone in a quiet forest or by a lake, or writing, or hiking aimlessly, or getting lost in a foreign country. He did get lost many times in Italy though.*/

  %p I am an LGBT person and I strongly support the LGBT movement.

  %p Feel free to contact me for any graphics, games, fun projects :) I am always seeking out for new and exciting opportunities.
