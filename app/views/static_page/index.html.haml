        %p My name is Trung. I'm currently a graduate student in my first year at the University of Pennsylvania in Computer Graphics and Game Technology.

        %p I have worked as a firmware engineer for Jawbone to build the UP3 fitness tracker wearable. I have chosen to go back to school to further focus in computer graphics. My mission is to build games for science education.
