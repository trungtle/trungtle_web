Delivered a wide range of infrastructural modules and applications for the ARM Cortex-M3 and the iOS platform, including BTLE protocol, authentication and encryption between band and phone, data collection, peripheral drivers, USB serial interface, band UX interactions and iOS developer tools to support research in sensor-based activity classification.

                        My interest in working with embedded system led me to take a position at Jawbone where I joined the firmware team developing the UP fitness wristband. Jawbone was successful at combining upscale fashion (lead designer Yves Behar) with the latest technology to set a new bar for the industry. This was a tremendous experience for me to dive deep into a large codebase in a real world embedded system with a plethora of peripherals communicating to the main processor ARM Cortex-M3; it was also an opportunity for me to get involved more in research by developing firmware and companion iOS apps for accelerometry and bioimpedance collection to build algorithm for activity classification. My favorite project was to implement a custom file storage on top of the serial flash, because it required me to think about hardware limitation, flash driver abstraction, and external API for client programs. At first, I had trouble creating a flexible, yet maintainable code because of my inexperienced, overly complex design and the lack of understanding in  the requirements and constraints of the project. To improve my knowledge, I studied the ARM Cortex-M3 Developer Guide and serial flash specifications, with other books on programming practices, including Effective C++ by Scott Meyers and Hackers & Painters by Paul Graham. I reiterated and improved the module greatly by removing unused APIs, declaring invariants in the design, and creating stricter abstraction between callers, API layer, and the flash driver. Learning to grow as a strong developer, over the course of two years at Jawbone, I was able to deliver cleaner and more maintainable codes such as the BTLE protocol, encryption and authentication between band and phone, and band UX interaction. This was when I learned of the limitation on battery life of a small embedded device. To get up to a week of usage, we often made touch choices to disable sensors and peripherals, compromise on UI animation, and reduce complexity of algorithm. I realized that new battery technology and energy alternative was needed to create game changing wearables.

                        What caught my attention about the Jawbone UP was also the way it changed  people's lives by helping them live healthier. The success of the product came from its human-centric design. When implementing captouch, LED animation, and haptic feedback for the design team, I learned to create patterns and interaction that were simplest to understand. And when working with the iOS team, I learned that step count, sleep stages, and caloric intake must translate to actionable insights that a person could improve upon, leading them to keep an earlier bed time (even during weekends), or to compete with friends for longer walks. Even though design is not my expertise, being exposed to it made me think more about the human interaction with computers and how we can positively enhance a person’s experience with attention to human factors.

                        This was undergraduate teaching assistant position for the introductory hardware design course (CSE352) at UW, under Professor Mark Oskin. I learned quickly that I had to understand the materials beyond the context of textbooks and assignments, so I researched additional materials in parallel with the lessons in class. Since I was mainly in charge of running the lab sections, I got to spend time with different ways to complete the lab assignments - usually a writing of Verilog for different modules that were eventually put together into a RISC computer on a FPGA - to prepare for troubleshooting and explaining questions later when the students arrived. Every question asked was an opportunity for me to test my knowledge of RISC, Verilog and FPGA in depth, and I found teaching to be a greatly rewarding endeavor.
