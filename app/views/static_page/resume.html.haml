                        My interest in working with embedded system led me to take a position at Jawbone where I joined the firmware team developing the UP3 fitness wristband. Jawbone was successful at combining upscale fashion (lead designer Yves Behar and his

                        about designing UP) with the latest technology to set a new bar for the industry. This was a tremendous experience for me to dive deep into a large codebase in a real world embedded system with a plethora of peripherals communicating to the main processor ARM Cortex-M3; it was also an opportunity for me to get involved more in research by developing firmware and companion iOS apps for accelerometry and bioimpedance collection to build algorithm for activity classification.

                        This was undergraduate teaching assistant position for the introductory hardware design course (CSE352) at UW, under Professor Mark Oskin. I learned quickly that I had to understand the materials beyond the context of textbooks and assignments, so I researched additional materials in parallel with the lessons in class. Since I was mainly in charge of running the lab sections, I got to spend time with different ways to complete the lab assignments - usually a writing of Verilog for different modules that were eventually put together into a RISC computer on a FPGA - to prepare for troubleshooting and explaining questions later when the students arrived. Every question asked was an opportunity for me to test my knowledge of RISC, Verilog and FPGA in depth, and I found teaching to be a greatly rewarding endeavor.
